    <p>Most often, the phrase “meat and potatoes” means a lack of eating adventure. A “meat and potatoes” person shies away from green vegetables, plant-based proteins like tofu, and spices.</p>
    <p>As someone who embraces a diverse diet and certainly doesnU+2019t want to waste her time on bland food, I am biased in the opposite direction. How could meat and potatoes possibly be anything but boooorrrrring?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lean Ground Beef. The flavorful and scrumptious meat for this dish. I don&apos;t typically use oil with ground beef &lpar;the fat in the beef is sufficient enough for it to cook without sticking&rpar;, but if your beef is ultra lean and your pan seems dry at any point, you can drizzle in a bit of oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Potatoes. Tender cubed potatoes are a slam dunk pairing with the ground beef (or mash them with ground beef like in Shepherd&apos;s Pie). They&apos;re nutritious, crowd-pleasing, and pair beautifully with the spices in this dish.</li>
        <li>Red Bell Pepper. Adds a touch of color, freshness, and sweetness. &lpar;Unless you're like me and get heartburn from nightshades you might replace this ingridient with diced white onion for similar results.&rpar;</li>
        <li>Worcestershire Sauce. Gives the dish depth and umami flavor.</li>
        <li>Dijon Mustard. Its tanginess pairs wonderfully with the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Spices. A blend of smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and oregano elevates this dish from bland to something truly craveable.</li>
        <li>Hot Sauce. For a delicious kick! Use a lot or use a little to fit your taste preferences.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the potatoes in oil.</li>
        <li>Brown the beef with the vegetables, Worcestershire, mustard, spices, and hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook until the vegetables are tender and the meat is cooked through. Add the green onions. Serve as desired and ENJOY!</li>
    </ol>

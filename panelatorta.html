    <p>Slices of queso fresco, fresh avocado and tangly, pickled jalape単os on a 
        mayonnaise slathered telera bun is our stadium food. My husband was surprised 
        I put these together without a game to cheer at. Although he thoroughly enjoyed 
        it and would never say no to one of the best tortas he&apos;s ever had.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t skimp on any of these ingredients. This torta can be prepared with 
            teleras, bolillos, baguettes and sourdough slices. Whatever you have on hand. 
            You can also add onion and tomato slices but we are minimalists. This is 
            perfect for us.</p>
